Steps to Follow:
Load the Xception Model: The keras.applications.xception.Xception is loaded without the top layers, so it will focus on the convolutional filters.

Compute Loss: The compute_loss function is defined to calculate the activation for a specific filter in the selected convolutional layer.

Gradient Ascent: The gradient_ascent_step function updates the image to increase the activation of the specified filter.

Image Generation: The generate_filter_pattern function generates an image for each filter using gradient ascent.

Deprocess Image: After optimizing the image for a filter, deprocess_image converts the tensor back into a valid image format that can be visualized.

Visualizing Filters: The code visualizes the first 64 filters in a convolutional layer (block3_sepconv1) of the Xception model. These filter images are stitched together into a grid and saved.

Output:
The filters for the layer block3_sepconv1 will be visualized and saved as an image file filters_for_layer_block3_sepconv1.png.
The stitched filters will also be displayed using matplotlib.
You Can Customize:
Layer: You can change layer_name = "block3_sepconv1" to any other convolutional layer in the Xception model.
Filter Count: Adjust the number of filters visualized by changing the range in the loop: for filter_index in range(64).
Learning Rate and Iterations: Modify iterations and learning_rate in generate_filter_pattern to control the optimization process.
